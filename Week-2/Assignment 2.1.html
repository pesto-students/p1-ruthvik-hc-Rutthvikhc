                    <p>Dogs, often hailed as humans best friends, have been the topic of many scientific studies looking into how they might boost our well-being. In this Spotlight, we'll explain how your friendly pup can benefit your health across the board.
                       According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States.
                       It is unclear when dogs were first domesticated, but a 
                       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms16082">study</a>
                       published last year claims that, at least in Europe, dogs were tamed 20,000–40,000 years ago.
                       It is likely that humans and dogs have shared a special bond of friendship and mutual support ever since at least the Neolithic period — but why has this bond been so long-lasting?
                       Of course, these cousins of the wolves have historically been great at keeping us and our dwellings safe, guarding our houses, our cattle, and our various material goods. Throughout history, humans have also trained dogs to assist them with hunting, or they have bred numerous quirky-looking species for their cuteness or elegance.

                    <h2>How dogs keep you in good health</h2>
                    <p>Many studies have suggested that having dogs as pets is associated with better physical health, as reviewsTrusted Source of the existing literature show. These findings persist.
                        Just last year, Medical News Today reported on a study that showed that owning a dog reduces a person’s risk of premature death by up to a third.
                        Also, researchers at the University of Harvard in Cambridge, MA, suggest that dog owners have a lower risk of heart disease.             
                        Why is that? It is difficult to establish a causal relationship between owning a dog and enjoying better health.
                    </p>
                    <h2>‘Dogs make people feel good’</h2>
                    <p>Perhaps the most intuitive benefit of sharing your life and home with a canine friend is that dogs give you “feel-good vibes” almost instantly.
                        It is really difficult not to cheer up, even after a hard day’s work, when you are greeted with — often vocal — enthusiasm by a friendly dog.
                        This, researchers explain, is due to the effect of the “love hormone” oxytocin.                       
                        “During the last decades,” write the authors of a review that featured in Frontiers in Psychology, “animal assistance in therapy, education, and care has greatly increased.”
